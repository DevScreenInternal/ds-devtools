## How to contribute

Contributions are very welcome and appreciated! Here are some notes to make sure you get the most out of contributing to this project:

We use Github to manage bugs, feature requests and pull requests. Please open an issue to get started.

Before you spend time adding a new feature, please create an issue to discuss with us before spending time on it. Maybe it's someting we've already thought of and we have a plan for how to build it.

If you're creating an issue for a bug, please add information on how to reproduce it, as well as what rbowser you're using and sample data, if applicable.

Please be respectful! This is a side-project in DevScreen and while we try to get back to everyone quickly, it may take a few days depending on the workload in other areas of the business.
