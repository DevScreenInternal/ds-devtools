#Â DS Dev Tools

## About

This project is a privacy-conscious developer tools application. There are lots of great online tools to help us with this, but many of them transmit our data and process the it on a server. This can present a security risk. By using this (https://devtools.devscreen.io or self-hosted), you can rest assured that your data doesn't leave your computer.

## Contributing & self-hosting

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/DevScreenInternal/ds-devtools.git`
1. `cd ds-devtools`
1. Install the dependencies. We use npm.: `npm install`
1. Run the local server `npm run dev`

Please create a Github issue if you're going to add a new feature or want to raise a bug. Pull requests are, of course, very welcome. For larger changes, it's recommended to create an issue before creating a PR so we can discuss the changes.
