# Developer Tools

## About

This project is a suite of privacy-conscious developer tools that doesn't rely on any backend service. There are lots of great online tools to help developers with common tasks, but many of them transmit our data and process the it on a server. This can present a security risk, especially if the information is not public. By using this (https://devtools.devscreen.io or self-hosted), your data doesn't leave your browser.

## Contributing & self-hosting

This is a static single page web application, so there are no backend services or databases needed. To run the application:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/DevScreenInternal/ds-devtools.git`
1. `cd ds-devtools`
1. Install the dependencies. We use npm.: `npm install`
1. Run the local server `npm run dev`

Please create a Github issue if you're going to add a new feature or want to raise a bug. Pull requests are, of course, very welcome. For larger changes, it's recommended to create an issue before creating a PR so we can discuss the changes.
